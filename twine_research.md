## 2. howling dogs (Porpentine, 2012)
A landmark hypertext game structured around daily “dream” sequences that the player can experience in different orders.

Navigation is also distinguished by colored text links, reinforcing mood and disorientation【732122838055589†L139-L141】【732122838055589†L181-L190】.

## 5. my father’s long, long legs (Michael Lutz, 2013)
A horror story told through first-person narration, gradually descending into surreal terror. It is praised for pacing, atmosphere, and the effective use of Twine passages to create dread. Its straightforward branching conceals carefully timed reveals, making it structurally elegant【593352529274960†L83-L100】.

## 6. the uncle who works for Nintendo (Michael Lutz, 2014)
A nostalgic yet unsettling story that plays with urban legends and childhood fears.

Its effective use of repetition and slight variation creates mounting unease【536078316197370†L101-L120】.

## 7. Lux (Juhana Leinonen, 2015)
A puzzle-heavy Twine game that incorporates inventory management, spatial navigation, and logical problem-solving. Its structure resembles parser IF but uses hyperlink mechanics.
